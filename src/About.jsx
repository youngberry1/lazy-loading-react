            </h1>

            <p className='text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4'>
               Tesla Motors, founded in 2003 by a group of engineers including
               Elon Musk, set out with a bold mission ‚Äî to accelerate the
               world‚Äôs transition to sustainable energy. Today, Tesla is a
               leader in electric vehicles, clean energy solutions, and
               cutting-edge battery technology.
            </p>

            <p className='text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4'>
               The company‚Äôs first car, the Roadster, proved that electric
               vehicles could deliver incredible performance. Later models like
               the Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y made EVs accessible to
               a much wider audience while setting new standards for safety and
               efficiency.
            </p>

            <p className='text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4'>
               Beyond cars, Tesla has expanded into solar panels, battery
               storage systems, and autonomous driving software. Each innovation
               brings the company closer to its vision of a cleaner, more
               sustainable future for all.
